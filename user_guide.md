## Components

### Web Scraping

The web scraping component automatically collects company information from business directories and websites. It targets the industries specified in your configuration and extracts:

- Company name
- Website
- Industry
- Company size
- Current chatbot usage
- Contact information
- Location data

The scraped data is saved in both CSV and JSON formats in the `/home/ubuntu/lead_generation/data` directory and imported into the lead database.

### LinkedIn Automation

The LinkedIn automation component has two main functions:

1. **Profile Finder**: Enriches lead data by finding LinkedIn profiles for company contacts
2. **Connection Automation**: Sends personalized connection requests and follow-up messages

The system uses industry-specific templates for connection requests and messages, increasing the chances of positive responses.

### Email Outreach

The email outreach component manages email campaigns with:

- Initial outreach emails
- Follow-up sequences
- Final attempt messages

All emails are personalized based on the lead's industry, company size, and other factors. The system tracks email opens, clicks, and replies to measure campaign effectiveness.

### Lead Database

The lead database stores all information about:

- Companies
- Contacts
- Interactions
- Lead status
- Campaign performance

The database is automatically backed up according to the schedule in your configuration.

## Database Management

### Database Structure

The lead database consists of several tables:

- **companies**: Stores company information
- **contacts**: Stores contact information for each company
- **interactions**: Records all interactions with leads
- **lead_status**: Tracks the current status of each lead
- **email_campaigns**: Manages email campaigns
- **linkedin_campaigns**: Manages LinkedIn campaigns
- **tags**: Allows categorizing leads with custom tags

### Importing Leads

To import leads from a CSV file:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/lead_generation/database
python3 lead_database.py --import-csv /path/to/leads.csv
```

### Exporting Leads

To export leads to a CSV file:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/lead_generation/database
python3 lead_database.py --export-csv /path/to/export.csv
```

### Generating Sample Data

For testing purposes, you can generate sample data:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/lead_generation/database
python3 lead_database.py --generate-sample --sample-size 50
```

## Reporting

The system automatically generates reports after each run. Reports are saved in the `/home/ubuntu/lead_generation/automation/reports` directory.

Each report includes:

- Total number of leads
- Breakdown by status
- Breakdown by industry
- Upcoming follow-ups
- Recent activity

Reports are generated in HTML format for easy viewing and sharing.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Missing Dependencies

If you encounter errors about missing modules, run the installation script again:

```bash
python3 /home/ubuntu/lead_generation/install_requirements.py
```

#### Database Connection Issues

If you have database connection issues, check:

1. The database path in your configuration
2. Permissions on the database file and directory
3. Whether SQLite is installed correctly

#### Web Scraping Failures

If web scraping fails:

1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify that the target websites are accessible
3. Consider using different user agents or proxies

#### LinkedIn Rate Limiting

If LinkedIn automation is being rate-limited:

1. Reduce the connection_limit_per_day in your configuration
2. Add random delays between actions
3. Consider using multiple LinkedIn accounts

### Logs

Detailed logs are saved in the `/home/ubuntu/lead_generation/automation/logs` directory. Check these logs for troubleshooting information.

## Best Practices

### Lead Generation Strategy

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a small number of leads to test the system

4. **Follow Up Consistently**: Set appropriate follow-up intervals (3-7 days recommended)
5. **Monitor Performance**: Regularly check reports to optimize your approach

### System Maintenance

1. **Regular Backups**: Ensure database backups are running as scheduled
2. **Update Dependencies**: Periodically update Python packages
3. **Monitor Disk Space**: Check that there's sufficient space for logs and data
4. **Review Logs**: Regularly check logs for warnings or errors
5. **Test New Features**: Test in a controlled environment before deploying changes

### Compliance Considerations

1. **Respect Rate Limits**: Stay within LinkedIn and email service provider limits
